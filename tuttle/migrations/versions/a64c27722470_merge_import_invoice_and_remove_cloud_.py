Revision ID: a64c27722470
Revises: b4129a32cae4, e10551639fd3
Create Date: 2026-06-21 19:08:39.931802

======================================================================
FROZEN HISTORICAL SNAPSHOT — NOT THE SCHEMA SOURCE OF TRUTH.

The source of truth is tuttle/model.py. This file captures the schema
DELTA from the previous revision to this point in history. It is
APPEND-ONLY: once committed, never edit it. To change the schema, edit
tuttle/model.py and run `just migrate "<msg>"` to ADD a new revision.

Reading this file to learn the current schema is a MISTAKE — it is a
point-in-time snapshot. Read tuttle/model.py instead.
======================================================================

MANDATORY REVIEW CHECKLIST before committing this file:

1. RENAMES — autogenerate emits drop_column + add_column for renames,
   which DESTROYS DATA. If you intended a rename, replace the pair with
   op.alter_column(<table>, <old>, new_column_name=<new>).

2. NO MODEL IMPORTS — never `from tuttle.model import ...` here.
   Model classes drift over time; this script must be pinned to the
   schema at this point in history. For data transformations, declare
   a local sa.table(...) snapshot with only the columns this revision
   touches.

3. BATCH MODE — render_as_batch=True rebuilds tables for SQLite. After
   a batch op on a table with foreign keys, verify integrity inside the
   migration: op.execute("PRAGMA foreign_key_check").

See tuttle/migrations/README.md.

    Tuttle is a single-user desktop app. Rolling back schema is destructive
    (data in dropped columns is lost) and offers nothing over restoring a

    If you need to iterate on a migration during development:
    1. Delete this revision file (versions/a64c27722470_*.py)
    2. Run `just reset` to wipe ~/.tuttle
    3. Edit model.py, run `just migrate` again
